3 observable trends based on collected data:

1.	Overall, there is a correlation between distance from the equator and temperature. From my collected data, this correlation was stronger in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. This observation could be skewed due to the data collected. 
2.	The other variables measured in my plots (wind speed, cloudiness, humidity) values were shown to be wide-spread across different latitudes with no correlation between the two variables. 
3.	The scatter plot of wind speed showed that most places on my collected data had a windspeed below 10mph, while very few places had wind speeds 15mph or higher. This leads me to conclude that high wind speed is not a common weather trend in general across the world.
